# Weather Forecast

This is a web-application that uses the OpenWeather and GeoDB Cities APIs in order to find the weather/forecast of any city in the world. The GeoDB Cities API locates the longitude and latitude of the selected city, and the information is used to help find the specific weather and forecast using the OpenWeather API. Information that is displayed is the temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, sea level, wind speed, and type of weather (cloudy, sunny, etc.).
