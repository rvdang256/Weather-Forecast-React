# Weather Forecast

This is a web-application that uses the OpenWeather and GeoDB Cities APIs in order to find the weather/forecast of any city in the world. The GeoDB Cities API locates the longitude and latitude of the selected city, and the information is used to help find the specific weather and forecast using the OpenWeather API. Information that is displayed is the temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, sea level, wind speed, and type of weather (cloudy, sunny, etc.). Note, since I am using a free subscription to the APIs, there is limitations to them. For instance, the weather will not be as precise, and when searching for a city, a max of 10 cities will appear in the search options. Thus, there is a chance that when looking up a specific city, it will not show up as one of the options. Link to the website is https://rvdang256.github.io/Weather-Forecast-React/
